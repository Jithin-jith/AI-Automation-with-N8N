# Email Automation

This is a basic automation for a boutique to track the orders of the customer and send the order details via email. This will also save the details in a google spreadsheet.

The workflow follows the following the steps
 - **Lankara order form** - This form allows the boutique to fill details of the customer order.
 - **Gmail Message** - Once the form is submitted a email will be sent to the boutique team informing them about the new order.
 - **Google spreadsheet** - The order details will also get stored in the google spreadsheet serving as a database for future tracking and analysis.
